    <h1 class="centered-heading">About Mark</h1>
    <p>Welcome, quantum consciousness vessels, to the hyperdimensional thought-sphere of Mark O'Sullivan, 
       Primordial Archon of Cognitive Deconstruction. Prepare for total ego dissolution as you traverse the non-Euclidean mindscape 
       of post-post-post-modern metacognition. Here, we don't just think outside the boxâ€”we transmute the box into a Klein bottle of 
       infinite semantic recursion. Marvel as we alchemize the mundane into the sublime through our proprietary process of synaptic teleportation 
       and lexical mitosis. Warning: prolonged exposure may result in spontaneous enlightenment, chronic ontological vertigo, or the sudden realization
       that you're actually a butterfly dreaming it's a philosophy website. Embrace the chaos, for in the words of the great Mark himself: "To understand 
       everything is to understand nothing, but to understand nothing is to understand everything." Let the metaphysical madness commence!</p>
